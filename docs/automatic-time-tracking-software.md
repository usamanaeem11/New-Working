## What is Automatic Time Tracking?

Automatic time tracking software monitors employee work hours without manual input. The system detects activity, tracks applications used, and categorizes time across projects automatically.

Unlike traditional timesheets where employees log hours manually, automatic time tracking software runs silently in the background. It captures keyboard activity, mouse movements, and application usage to determine productive work time.

### How It Works

The technology uses three core components:

**Activity Detection**
- Monitors keyboard and mouse input
- Tracks active applications and windows
- Detects idle time automatically
- Records work patterns in real-time

**Smart Categorization**
- Assigns time to specific projects using AI
- Distinguishes billable vs non-billable hours
- Identifies productive vs unproductive activities
- Generates automatic time reports

**Real-Time Reporting**
- Provides live productivity dashboards
- Shows current team activity
- Tracks project budget consumption
- Alerts managers to potential issues
